        ## Oftentimes, applicatins need to be restarted once once their configuration has been updated. However,
        ## Kubernetes makes the assumption that watching the file for configuration change is the applications
        ## responsibiliy, and doesn't restart when files change. So, the lines below modify a propery that does trigger
        ## a rotation of the applications so they are restarted when their dependencies change.

      ## Volumes are how Kubernetes expresses either networked storage or other metadata in the filesystem. There are
      ## storage types, the most useful of which are illustrated below. Remember to uncomment the volumes: node if you
      ## decide to use them!
      ##
      volumes:
      ##
      ## EMPTY DIR - Useful for scratch space, such as for CI
      ##
      #   - name: "__VOLUME_NAME__"
      #     emptyDir: {}
      ##
      ## HOST PATH - Useful when mounting some host proprty into hte container
      ##
      #   - name: "__VOLUME_NAME__"
      #     hostPath:
      #       path: "/path/to/your/folder"
      ##
      ## PERSISTENT VOLUME CLAIM - Useful to access network storage. Should be used in preference to GcePersistantDisk
      ##                           et. al. You will need to define a persistent volume as well, for this to work.
      ##

          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: {{ template "ada-stake-pool.pvcName" . }}-bpnode

      #   - name: "__VOLUME_NAME__"
      #     configMap:
      #       name: "__CONFIGMAP_NAME__"
      ##
      ## Note: You can also use single files from a configmap, with a syntax called "subPath". An example is below:
      ##
      #   - name: "__VOLUME_NAME__"
      #     configMap:
      #       name: "__CONFIGMAP_NAME__"
      #       items:
      #         - key: "__ITEM_KEY__"
      #           path: "path/to/item"
      ##
      ## SECRET
      ##
      #   - name: "__VOLUME_NAME__"
      #     secret:
      #       secretName: "__SECRET_NAME__"

          ## There are three types or readiness probes:
          ##
          ## More generally, a liveness probe is used to determine whether the application is "healthy" and should
          ## recieve traffic. Whereas, a readiness probe is used to determine whether the application has finished
          ## its boot and is now online
          ##
          ## - HTTP Liveness
          ## - TCP Liveness
          ## - Exec liveness
          ##
          ## Below are examples of each healthcheck type with descriptions of when to use them
          ##
          # livenessProbe:
            ##
            # tcpSocket:
            ##
            ## The "tcpSocket" health check is useful for when an application exposes a port, but there are no utilities
            ## to determine whether that application is healthy over that port. So, the fact the application is
            ## listening on that port is taken as a "proxy" health measure.
            ##
            ##
              # port: "__CONTAINER_PORT_NAME__"
              ## Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness probes are initiated.

            ## The "exec" healthcheck is useful when there is a bundled program to determine whether the application is
            ## healthy (such as "mysqladmin ping"). It is also useful if the application does not open a network port
            ## for communicating with other applications, but still represents its state on disk somehow.
            ##
              ## The command executed by exec is expected to return "0" to indicate healthy, and any nonzero status code
              ## to indicate unhealthy.

            ## As the name implies, the "httpGet" health check places a HTTP GET request to an endpoint defined by the
            ## the application. It seems to be the superior method of health checking where the application supports
            ## HTTP, as the semantics are known and usually reliable.
            ##
              ## The path that the HTTP GET request will be made to. Any code > 200 and < 400 is OK. Any other code is
